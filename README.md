# knowledge-graph-rag-llama-index
This repository demonstrates how to integrate Llama-Index and a knowledge graph into the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. By doing so, it enables the retrieval of information from a large-scale knowledge base and improves the performance of natural language generation tasks.

## Overview
The RAG architecture is a powerful approach to natural language generation that leverages retrieved information to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. By integrating a knowledge graph into the RAG architecture, we can tap into a vast source of structured and interconnected information, enabling the model to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

This project utilizes the Llama-Index library to efficiently index and query the knowledge graph, allowing for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant information during the generation process. The library provides a simple and intuitive interface for working with knowledge graphs and integrating them into the RAG pipeline.

For a detailed explanation of the concepts and techniques used in this project, please refer to the following article: [Knowledge Graphs for RAG (WIP)](https://harheems.notion.site/Knowledge-Graphs-for-RAG-WIP-124a6035deb544a4ba7a2ffec67a1231?pvs=4), 

This project is based on the concepts and techniques outlined in the article ["Implement RAG with Knowledge Graph and Llama-Index"](https://medium.aiplanet.com/implement-rag-with-knowledge-graph-and-llama-index-6a3370e93cdd), which serves as a foundation for integrating knowledge graphs into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using the Llama-Index library.
